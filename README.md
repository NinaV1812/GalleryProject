# Gallery project

## Project description:
'You should create small, mobile application which will have only two views.
First view will display list of the products with title, one image (thumbnail) and price.
Second view should display title, description, specification, price, and product images.
Product Images should be displayed as a small gallery, you should use "original" property to display large/selected image.

As a bonus you can add possibility of adding comments for each of the products. They shouldn't be sent to server; it will be enough to save them in local storage and display them at single product page.'
